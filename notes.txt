A through table (like our post_tag table)

CREATE TABLE puppy_tricks (
  "puppyId" INTEGER REFERENCES puppies(id),
  "trickId" INTEGER REFERENCE tricks(id),
  UNIQUE ("puppyId", "trickId")
);


When we do square brackets, we are only taking a single item from the rows 
When we do not hav square brackets, we get all of them.
